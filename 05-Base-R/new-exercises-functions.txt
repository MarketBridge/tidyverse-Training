People also need to learn how to create functions and use conditionals. Some example exercises I used recently in a mentoring session:

Write a function that greets you by name:
  -Start with something hard-coded: print(“Hi Bob”)
  -Modify to take the name as an argument
  -Add a default parameter

If statements:
  -%% operator
  -Function to print if a number is even or odd

Back to the “Hi Bob” function:
  -Take a second parameter “time_of_day”
  -If “morning” print “Good morning <name>”, etc.
  -?stop if time_of_day is not valid
